(** Type definitions from BFD library.

    Note: this definitions are taken from a correspoind
    libtrace/arch.hpp header file and doesn't correspond to
    a most recent version of the BFD library.

    A enum [X_Y_Z] in general maps to [X.Y.Z] constructor,
    with the following caveats:
    - [X],[Y] and [Z] are capitalized
    - sometimes, BFD break there own naming scheme, so [X.Y]
    sometimes maps to [X._.Y], e.g., [bfd_mach_arm] maps to
    [Bfd.Mach.Arm.Arm], c.f., a more correct [bfd_mach_i386_i386],
    that maps to [Bfd.Mach.I386.I386]

    The [enum] processor will derive the following functions:
    - [to_enum : t -> int]
    - [of_enum : int -> t option]
    - [max, min]
